Hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system, such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory, storage devices, and input/output devices. Software refers to the programs that run on a computer system, such as the operating system, applications, and utilities. Data refers to the information that is processed by a computer system, such as text, images, and videos. People refer to the users of a computer system, such as programmers, system administrators, and end users. These components work together to create a computing environment that can perform a wide range of tasks, from word processing to video editing to web browsing. By understanding the interrelationships between these components, you can better understand how a computer system works and how to make the most of it."
